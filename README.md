# MongoDB Aggregation Bug: Incorrect Average Calculation

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines, specifically when calculating averages from arrays that may contain missing fields. The issue occurs when attempting to access a field ('body' in this case) which might not always exist within the array elements processed in the `$avg` aggregation stage. This causes the aggregation pipeline to either return an error or produce inaccurate results, impacting the reliability of the overall data analysis.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, showcasing the incorrect aggregation implementation leading to inaccurate averages.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected solution, addressing the issue of missing fields and ensuring that the average is calculated correctly.

## Steps to reproduce:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running.
3. Create a `users` collection and a `posts` collection in MongoDB, populating them with sample data that reflects the structures described in the code. Ensure some posts have missing or empty 'body' fields.
4. Run the code in `bug.js`. Observe the incorrect results.
5. Run the code in `bugSolution.js` to see the correct results.

## Solutions:
The solution involves handling missing fields appropriately within the aggregation pipeline.  This can be accomplished using the `$ifNull` or `$cond` operators to provide default values when the 'body' field is missing.
